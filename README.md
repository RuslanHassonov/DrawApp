# DrawApp
## v1.0
First iteration of a simple app that allows the user to choose color values and dimension values. Also allows the user to preview the choices
he/she made before applying the shape in the output canvas below.

## v1.5
Added the ability to save prefered colors to an SQL Server Database. Still working on implementing the same functionality for the shapes.

--Known Issue: When one tries to save a new shape to database, the color of the shape is added to the list of the colors (even when the color already exists). This should not happen and is being looked at.
